ðŸš€ **Currently Building ShareRide**

As the founding engineer of ShareRide, a startup I co-founded, I'm deeply involved in crafting a solution to Nairobi's commuting challenges. 

ShareRide is designed specifically for the city's middle-class population, offering an innovative ride-sharing platform that bridges the gap between expensive ride-hailing services and crowded public transport. By connecting private car owners with commuters heading in the same direction, we aim to provide a quicker, more comfortable, and affordable way to travel across the city.
